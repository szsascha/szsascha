### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sascha and I'm a full-time Senior Software-Development Consultant. Currently working on the backend of large Java projects.
Prior to that, I spent a decade of developing and supporting large logistics solutions for big companies on IBM i.

In my free time, I really like to learn new things and take on challenges. Not only on software development, but also in sports.

Most of my Github repositories were created while I was learning new technologies and wanted to share my new learned knowledge.

#### Some open source projects I've contributed to
- [vuejs/vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress)
- [halcyon-tech/vscode-ibmi](https://github.com/halcyon-tech/vscode-ibmi)
