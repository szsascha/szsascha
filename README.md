### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sascha and I'm a full-time Senior Software-Development Consultant and Data Protection Officer. Currently working on the backend of large Java projects.
Prior to that, I spent a decade of developing and supporting large logistics solutions for big companies on IBM i in several programming languages like RPG and Java.

In my free time, I really like to learn new things and take on challenges. Not only in software development, but also in sports.

Most of my Github repositories were created while I was learning new technologies and wanted to share my new learned knowledge.

#### Some open source projects I've contributed code to:
- [pocketbase/pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase)
- [vuejs/vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress)
- [halcyon-tech/vscode-ibmi](https://github.com/halcyon-tech/vscode-ibmi)
- [worksofliam/NetRPG](https://github.com/worksofliam/NetRPG)
- [Danjb1/anno-1602-reader](https://github.com/Danjb1/anno-1602-reader)
